## Overview
I completed this project using HTML and CSS styling, I used HTML to create the structure of the QR code and CSS styling to customise its appearance.In addition, I carefully implemented the neccessary HTML elements to generate the QR code pattern and then applied CSS styles to modify its colors, shapes and overall visual representation.

## My process
   I used a div element to create the neccessary container for this project, then used media query to create the appropriate visual presentation for both mobile and desktop view. Used margin, padding for the right positioning of the project.

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS media Query

### What I learned
 This project has helped me to get a better understanding of CSS positioning and the use of media query.

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development
I would love to get a better understanding of Flex-box properties and styling.
